## Done
Not done:
- use `https://highlightjs.org/` for displaying the code
- front-end (`client`):
    - pages:
        - landing (?)
        - login
        - logoff
        - register
        - admin dashboard
        - user settings
        - code snippets/commentary etc. 
    - functionality:
        - search bar 
        - navbar
        - comments: add/edit/delete
        - code snippets: add/edit/delete
        - up/downvote
        - user image upload
        - RBAC/Roles/Responsibilities handling 
    - UI design: Materialize, React, Template engine, CSS (?)
- back-end (`server`):
    - user input verification
        * login: username(email), password)
        * register: first name, last name, email, password, nick)
        * input code blocks
        * routes (has to do with capturing different range of addresses and case sensitivity; very different approach to the above, but still may be relevant)
    - choice of authentication method:
        * header: a) enables server side rendering, b) and usage of template engines and c) client is always known therefore rendering can be directly applied to a specific group 
        * local storage (most likely jwt): all has to be done client side: a) the code for all groups is always accessible b) template engines can't be used (not that they'd be used anyway if React, Angular, Vue etc. is used)

Done: 
- DB Schemas
- Routes
- UI design
